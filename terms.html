<p>
This section defines the terms used in this specification and throughout
<a>decentralized identifier</a> infrastructure. A link to these terms is
included whenever they appear in this specification.
</p>

<dl class="termlist">

  <dt><dfn data-lt="authenticated">authenticate</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
    Authentication is a process by which an entity can prove it has a specific
    attribute or controls a specific secret using one or more <a>verification
    methods</a>. With <a>DIDs</a>, a common example would be proving control of the
    cryptographic private key associated with a public key published in a <a>DID
    document</a>.
  </dd>

  <dt><dfn>binding</dfn></dt>
  <dd>A concrete mechanism through which a <a>client</a> invokes a <a>DID resolver</a>. This could be a <a>local binding</a> such as a local command line tool or library API, or a <a>remote binding</a> such as the <a href="#bindings-https">HTTP(S) binding</a>. See Section <a href="#resolver-architectures"></a>.</dd>

  <dt><dfn>client</dfn></dt>
  <dd>Software and/or hardware that invokes a <a>DID resolver</a> in order to execute the <a>DID resolution</a> and/or <a>DID URL dereferencing</a> algorithms. This invocation is done via a <a>binding</a>. The term <a>client</a> does not imply any specific network topology.</dd>

  <dt><dfn data-lt="">DID resolution result</dfn></dt>
  <dd>A data structure that represents the result of the <a>DID resolution</a> algorithm.
    May contain a <a>DID document</a>. See Section <a href="#did-resolution-result"></a>.</dd>

  <dt><dfn data-lt="">DID URL dereferencing result</dfn></dt>
  <dd>A data structure that represents the result of the <a>DID URL dereferencing</a> algorithm.
    May contain a <a>DID document</a> or other content. See Section <a href="#did-url-dereferencing-result"></a>.</dd>

  <dt><dfn data-lt="resources">resource</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
    As defined by [[RFC3986]]: "...the term 'resource' is used in a general sense
    for whatever might be identified by a URI." Similarly, any resource might serve
    as a <a>DID subject</a> identified by a <a>DID</a>.
  </dd>

  <dt><dfn data-lt="representations">representation</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
    As defined for HTTP by [[RFC9110]]: "information that is intended to reflect a
    past, current, or desired state of a given resource, in a format that can be
    readily communicated via the protocol. A representation consists of a set of
    representation metadata and a potentially unbounded stream of representation
    data." A <a>DID document</a> is a representation of information describing a
    <a>DID subject</a>. See <a data-cite="did-core#representations"></a>.
  </dd>

  <dt><dfn data-lt="">local binding</dfn></dt>
  <dd>A <a>binding</a> where the <a>client</a> invokes a <a>DID resolver</a> that runs on the same network host, e.g., via a local command line tool or library API.
    In this case, the <a>DID resolver</a> is sometimes also called a "local <a>DID resolver</a>".
    See Section <a href="#resolver-architectures"></a>.</dd>

  <dt><dfn data-lt="">remote binding</dfn></dt>
  <dd>A <a>binding</a> where the <a>client</a> invokes a <a>DID resolver</a> that runs on a different network host, e.g., via the <a href="#bindings-https">HTTP(S) binding</a>.
    In this case, the <a>DID resolver</a> is sometimes also called a "remote <a>DID resolver</a>".
    See Section <a href="#resolver-architectures"></a>.</dd>

  <dt><dfn data-lt="service">services</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
    Means of communicating or interacting with the <a>DID subject</a> or
    associated entities via one or more <a>service endpoints</a>.
    Examples include discovery services, agent services, social networking
    services, file storage services, and verifiable credential repository services.
  </dd>

  <dt><dfn data-lt="">unverifiable read</dfn></dt>
  <dd> A low confidence implementation of a <a>DID method's</a> "Read" operation between the
    <a>DID resolver</a> and the <a>verifiable data registry</a>, to obtain the <a>DID document</a>.
    There is no guarantee about the integrity and correctness of the result. See Section <a href="#method-architectures"></a>.</dd>

  <dt><dfn data-lt="">verification method</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      A set of parameters that can be used together with a process to independently
      verify a proof. For example, a cryptographic public key can be used as a
      verification method with respect to a digital signature; in such usage, it
      verifies that the signer possessed the associated cryptographic private key.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Verification" and "proof" in this definition are intended to apply broadly. For
      example, a cryptographic public key might be used during Diffie-Hellman key
      exchange to negotiate a shared symmetric key for encryption. This guarantees the
      integrity of the key agreement process. It is thus another type of verification
      method, even though descriptions of the process might not use the words
      "verification" or "proof."
    </p>
  </dd>

  <dt><dfn data-lt="">verifiable read</dfn></dt>
  <dd> A high confidence implementation of a <a>DID method's</a> "Read" operation between the
    <a>DID resolver</a> and the <a>verifiable data registry</a>, to obtain the <a>DID document</a>.
    There are guarantees about the integrity and correctness of the result to the extent possible under the applicable <a>DID method</a>.
    See Section <a href="#method-architectures"></a>.</dd>

  <dt><dfn data-lt="UUID|UUIDs">Universally Unique Identifier</dfn> (UUID)</dt>
  <dd>
    A type of globally unique identifier defined by [[RFC4122]]. UUIDs are similar
    to DIDs in that they do not require a centralized registration authority. UUIDs
    differ from DIDs in that they are not resolvable or
    cryptographically-verifiable.
  </dd>

  <dt><dfn data-lt="URI|URIs">Uniform Resource Identifier</dfn> (URI)</dt>
  <dd>
    The standard identifier format for all resources on the World Wide Web as
    defined by [[RFC3986]]. A <a>DID</a> is a type of URI scheme.
  </dd>
