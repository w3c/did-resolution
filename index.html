      <p>
Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) are a new type of identifier for
verifiable, "self-sovereign" digital identity. DIDs are fully under the
control of the DID subject, independent from any centralized registry,
identity provider, or certificate authority. DIDs resolve to DID
Documents — simple documents that describe how to use that specific DID.
      </p>

      <p>
This document specifies the interface and guidelines for the DID 
resolution process.
