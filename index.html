Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) are a new type of identifier for
verifiable, "self-sovereign" digital identity. DIDs are fully under the
control of the DID subject, independent from any centralized registry,
identity provider, or certificate authority. DIDs resolve to DID
Documents — simple documents that describe how to use that specific DID.
      </p>

      <p>
This document specifies the algorithms and guidelines for resolving DIDs
and dereferencing DID URLs.

<h1>Introduction</h1>

	<p><a>DID resolution</a> is the process of obtaining a <a>DID document</a> for a given <a>DID</a>. This is one
	of four required operations that can be performed on any DID ("Read"; the other ones being "Create", "Update",
	and "Deactivate"). The details of these operations differ depending on the <a>DID method</a>.
	Building on top of <a>DID resolution</a>, <a>DID URL dereferencing</a> is the process of obtaining a resource
	for a given <a>DID URL</a>. Software and/or hardware that is able to execute these processes is called
	a <a>DID resolver</a>.
	
	<p>This
	specification defines common
	requirements, algorithms including their inputs and results, architectural options, and various considerations for the
	<a>DID resolution</a> and <a>DID URL dereferencing</a> processes.</p>

	<p>Note that while this specification defines some base-level functionality for DID resolution, the actual steps
	required to communicate with a DID's <a>Decentralized Identifier Registry</a> are defined by the applicable
	<a>DID method</a> specification.</p>

	<p class="note">The difference between "resolving" a <a>DID</a> and "dereferencing" a <a>DID URL</a>
	is being thoroughly discussed by the community. E.g. see
	<a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/did-spec/issues/166#issuecomment-464502719">this comment</a>.</p>

	Explain the difference between "method architectures" and "binding architectures".</p>

	<section id="method-architectures">
		<h2>Method Architectures</h2>
		<p>The <a>DID resolution</a> algorithm involves executing the <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/#read-verify">Read</a>
		operation on a <a>DID</a> according to the DID's <a>method</a> (see <a href="#resolving"></a>).</p>

		<div class="note">
		<p>The mechanics of the "Read" operation can vary considerably between
		<a>DID methods</a>.</p>
		<p>No assumption should be made that:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>... an immutable blockchain is used as (part of) the <a>Decentralized Identifier Registry</a>.</li>
		<li>... interaction with a remote network is required during execution of the "Read" operation.</li>
		<li>... an actual <a>DID document</a> is stored in plain-text on a <a>Decentralized Identifier Registry</a>,
		or that the <a>DID document</a> can simply be retrieved via a standard protocol such as HTTP(S).
		While some <a>DID methods</a> may define their "Read" operation this way, others may
		define more complex multi-step processes that involve on-the-fly construction of a "virtual" <a>DID document</a>.</li>
		</ul>
		</div>

		<p>Depending on the exact nature of the <a>DID method's</a> "Read" operation, the interaction between a
		<a>DID resolver</a> and the <a>Decentralized Identifier Registry</a> may be described as "local" or "remote":</p>

		<p class="note">The terms "local" and "remote" are not absolute categories when describing DID methods
		and their implementations, but only an approximation with many possible variations.</p>
		<p class="issue">TODO: Describe full nodes vs. light clients, blockchain explorer APIs, state proofs, etc.</p>
		<p class="issue">TODO: Explain that even within a single <a>DID method</a>, different method architectures may be
		possible. For example, the "btcr" DID method could be implemented with "local" access to a full node, or with
		calls to a "remote" blockchain explorer API.</p>

		<p class="issue">As an example, mention what it means to "resolve" peer/off-ledger/microledger/edgechain DIDs (e.g. see

		<a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1UnC_nfOUK40WS5TD_EhyDuFe5cStX-u0Z7wjoae_PqQ/">here</a>).</p>

		<p class="issue">As an example, mention what it means to "resolve" DIDs that are simply wrapped public keys (e.g. see

		<a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/did-spec/pull/55">here</a>).</p>

		<p>A <a>DID resolver</a> MUST support the <a>DID resolution</a> algorithm for at least one <a>DID method</a> and
		MAY support it for multiple <a>DID methods</a>:</p>

	<section id="bindings-https">
		<h2>HTTP(S) Binding</h2>
		<p>This section defines a <a>DID resolver</a> <a>Binding</a> which exposes the
		<a>DID resolution</a> and/or <a>DID URL dereferencing</a> functions (including all
		input options and output data) via an HTTP(S) endpoint. See <a href="#binding-architectures"></a>.</p>
		<div class="issue">
			<p>TODO: Define HTTP(S) Binding for <a>DID resolution</a> and <a>DID URL dereferencing</a>,
			including the following topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>How are <var>input options</var> passed via HTTP(S)? Using the query string and/or HTTP headers?</li>
				<li>How is the output data (<a>DID document</a>, <a>DID resolution result</a>) returned via HTTP(S)</li>
				<li>What is the <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/did-spec/issues/82">MIME type of a DID document</a>?
				How should <code>Accept</code> and <code>Content-Type</code> HTTP headers be used?</li>
				<li>Are two separate HTTP(S) endpoints required/allowed for the <code>resolve()</code> and
				<code>dereference()</code> functions, or can/must a single HTTP(S) endpoint be used?</li>
			</ul>
		</div>

		<p>The HTTP(S) Binding for <a>DID resolvers</a> requires a known HTTP(S) URL called the
		<var><a>DID resolver</a> HTTP(S) endpoint</var>.</p>
		<p>Using this binding, the <a>DID resolution</a> function (see
		<a href="#resolving"></a>) and/or <a>DID URL dereferencing</a> function (see <a href="#dereferencing"></a>)
		can be executed as follows:</p>
		<ol class="algorithm">
			<li>Construct a <var>request HTTP(S) URL</var> by appending the <var>input <a>DID</a></var> or
			<var>input <a>DID URL</a></var> to the <var><a>DID resolver</a> HTTP(S) endpoint</var>.</li>
			<li>Execute an HTTP <code>GET</code> request on the <var>request HTTP(S) URL</var>.</li>
			<li>If the <var>input <a>DID</a></var> does not exist (i.e. the <a>DID resolution</a> function
			returns a null result):
			<ol class="algorithm">
				<li>The HTTP response status code MUST be <code>404</code>.</li>
			</ol>
			</li>
			<li>If the <var>input <a>DID</a></var> exists and the result is (part of) a <a>DID document</a>:
			<ol class="algorithm">
				<li>The HTTP response status code MUST be <code>200</code>.</li>
				<li>The HTTP response MUST contain a <code>Content-Type</code> header. The
				value of this header MUST be <code>application/did+ld+json</code>.</li>
				<li>The HTTP response body MUST contain the <var>resolved <a>DID document</a></var> or other
				<var>output resources</var> that is the reult of the <a>DID resolution</a> or
				<a>DID URL dereferencing</a> function.</li>
			</ol>
			</li>
			<li>If the <var>input <a>DID</a></var> exists and the result is a <a>service endpoint</a> URL:
			<ol class="algorithm">
				<li>The HTTP response status code MUST be <code>303</code>.</li>
				<li>The HTTP response MUST contain an <code>Location</code> header. The value of this header

	<section id="authentication">
		<h2>Authentication/Authorization</h2>
		<p><a>DID resolution</a> and <a>DID URL dereferencing</a> do not involve any authentication or authorization
		functionality. Similar to DNS resolution, anybody can perform the process, without requiring any credentials
		or non-public knowledge.</p>

		<p class="issue" data-number="38"></p>

		<div class="issue">
		<p>Explain that DIDs are not necessarily <em>globally</em> resolvable, such as pairwise or N-wise
		"peer" DIDs.</p>
		<p>See [[RFC3339]]:
		<em> URIs have a global scope and are interpreted consistently regardless of context, though the
		result of that interpretation may be in relation to the end-user's context.</em>
		</p>
		<p>An advanced idea is that the result of DID resolution could be contextual or depend on policies,
		see <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/did-resolution/issues/28#issuecomment-510592199">this comment</a>.</p>
		</div>

		<p class="issue">A related topic is whether (parts of) DID document could be encrypted, e.g. see
		<a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/did-spec/issues/172">w3c-ccg/did-spec/issues/172</a>. Also see the use

	<section id="caching">
		<h2>Caching</h2>
		<p>A <a>DID resolver</a> may maintain a generic cache of <a>DID documents</a>. It may also maintain caches specific
		to certain <a>DID methods</a>.</p>
		<p>Caching behavior can be controlled by configuration of the <a>DID resolver</a>,
		by the <a href="#resolving-input-no-cache">`no-cache`</a> input option, or by contents of the DID document
		(e.g. a `time-to-live` field), or by a combination of these options.</p>

		<h2>Versioning</h2>
		<p>If a <a href="#resolving-input-version-id">`version-id`</a> or
		<a href="#resolving-input-version-time">`version-time`</a> input option is provided, the <a>DID resolution</a>
		algorithm returns a certain version of the <a>DID document</a>.</p>
		<p>A DID document MAY contain a version identifier that changes with each

		on a DID.</p>
		<p class="issue" data-number="12">See corresponding open issue.</p>
		<p class="note">While all <a>DID methods</a> MUST support the <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/#update">Update</a>
		operation, there is no requirement for <a>DID methods</a> to keep all previous <a>DID document</a> versions, therefore
		not all <a>DID methods</a> support versioning.
