Decentralized identifiers (DIDs) are a new type of identifier for
verifiable, "self-sovereign" digital identity. DIDs are fully under the
control of the DID controller, independent from any centralized registry,
identity provider, or certificate authority. DIDs resolve to DID
Documents — simple documents that describe how to use that specific DID.

      <p>
This document specifies the algorithms and guidelines for resolving DIDs
and dereferencing DID URLs. Additionally, this document describes the
input and output metadata related to the DID resolution processes and
further describes the data structures that may be returned from a DID resolution
request.  This document relies on the core DID specification,
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-1.1/">Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) v1.1</a>,
which describes the underlying DID architecture in full detail.

<h1>Introduction</h1>

	<p><a>DID resolution</a> is the process of obtaining a <a>DID document</a> for a given <a>DID</a>. This is one
	of four required operations that can be performed on any DID ("Read"; the other ones being "Create", "Update",
	and "Deactivate"). The details of these operations differ depending on the <a>DID method</a>.
	Building on top of <a>DID resolution</a>, <a>DID URL dereferencing</a> is the process of retrieving a representation
	of a resource for a given <a>DID URL</a>. Software and/or hardware that is able to execute these processes is called
	a <a>DID resolver</a>.

	<p>This
	specification defines common
	requirements, algorithms including their inputs and results, architectural options, and various considerations for the
	<a>DID resolution</a> and <a>DID URL dereferencing</a> processes.</p>

	<p>Note that while this specification defines some base-level functionality for DID resolution, the actual steps
	required to communicate with a DID's <a>verifiable data registry</a> are defined by the applicable
	<a>DID method</a> specification.</p>

	<section id="implementer-overview" class="informative">
		<h2>Implementer Overview</h2>
		<p>
			By invoking a <a>DID resolver</a> using the standard <code>resolve(did, resolutionOptions)</code> interface (as defined in 
			the <a href="#resolving">DID Resolution section</a>) one can obtain a <a>DID document</a> and accompanying metadata 
			(e.g., `contentType`, proof, versioning) which an application can use to validate a user's cryptographic keys, 
			service endpoints, or status. 
		<p>
			For example, a wallet app could resolve <code>did:example:123?versionTime=2021-05-10T17:00:00Z</code> 
			using the `versionTime` parameter to retrieve the state of that DID at a past time, or a client could 
			dereference a DID URL 
			 like <code>did:example:123?service=files&relativeRef=/resume.pdf</code> 
			 (see <a href="#example-dereferencing-to-service-endpoint-url">here for detailed example</a>) 
			 to fetch a user's resume stored via a service declared in the DID document. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Further, the specification's <a href="#dereferencing-algorithm">DID URL dereferencing algorithm</a> shows how 
			a client can follow a fragment (e.g., <code>#key-1</code>) to extract a particular verification method from 
			the <a>DID document</a> (see <a href="#example-dereferencing-to-verification-method">here for detailed example</a>). 
			In practice, implementers validate their resolver against the 
			<a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/did-resolution-test-suite">DID Resolution Test Suite</a> which exercises 
			normative MUSTs and error conditions (such as invalid DIDs, deactivated DIDs, unsupported methods, 
			relative URL expansion, etc.) to ensure that client applications can reliably depend on correct resolution behavior 
			across different DID methods.

		<h2>
		  Audience
		</h2>
		<p>
This specification has three primary audiences: implementers of conformant DID methods;
implementers of conformant DID resolvers; and implementers of systems and services
that wish to resolve DIDs using DID resolvers. The intended audience includes,
but is not limited to, software architects, data modelers, application developers,
service developers, testers, operators, and user experience (UX) specialists.
Other people involved in a broad range of standards efforts related to decentralized
identity, verifiable credentials, and secure storage might also be interested in
reading this specification.
		</p>

		<h2>
		  Use Cases
		</h2>
		<p>
The DID resolution specification is intended to support a broad range of use cases
by defining a standardized interface to resolve DIDs and dereference DID URLs
independent of the DID method of any particular DID. These usecases include:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
A decentralized address book: By using DIDs as identifiers for people and organizations
within an address book, the controllers of those DIDs can independently update the contents of
their DID documents. Through DID resolution these DIDs can be resolved to obtain the 
current state of the DID document for any given contact, enabling persistent stable identifiers
with updatable services and verification material necessary for continued verifiable interactions. 
			</li>
			<li>
Verifying a Verifiable Credential: Verifiable Credentials are signed by an issuer and given to a 
holder. The holder can then create a Verifiable Presentation that is presented to a verifier.
Within the credential, if issuers and holders are identified using a DID, the verifier can 
use DID resolution to resolve the DID documents of the identified issuer and holder to obtain
the verification material necessary to verify the signatures on the Verifiable Presentation.
			</li>
			<li>
Auditability: DID resolution can be used to obtain the historical state of a DID document either
at a specific point in time or for a specific version. This can be used to audit the historical 
verifiable actions of a DID controller. For example, the issuance of a verifiable receipt or the 
signing of a contract.
			</li>
			<li>
DID URL based resource retrieval: A DID controller can add service endpoints to their DID document
that point to resources they control, for example a profile picture. By referencing these resources
using a DID URL, a web application can use DID resolution and DID URL dereferencing to retrieve the 
current version of the resource. The DID URL can act as a persistent, dereferencable identifier
for this resource, while the DID controller can independently change the resource over time.
			</li>
		</ul>

	<h2>DID Parameters</h2>

	<p>
		The <a>DID URL</a> syntax supports a simple format for parameters
		(see section <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#query">Query</a>
		in [[DID-CORE]]). Adding a DID
		parameter to a <a>DID URL</a> means that the parameter becomes part of the
		identifier for a <a>resource</a>.
	</p>

	<pre class="example nohighlight"
		 title="A DID URL with a 'versionTime' DID parameter">
did:example:123?versionTime=2021-05-10T17:00:00Z

	<pre class="example nohighlight"
		 title="A DID URL with a 'service' and a 'relativeRef' DID parameter">
did:example:123?service=files&amp;relativeRef=/resume.pdf
	</pre>

	<p>
		Some DID parameters are completely independent of any specific <a>DID
		method</a> and function the same way for all <a>DIDs</a>. Other DID parameters
		are not supported by all <a>DID methods</a>. Where optional parameters are
		supported, they are expected to operate uniformly across the <a>DID methods</a>
		that do support them. The following table provides common DID parameters that
		function the same way across all <a>DID methods</a>. Support for all
		<a href="#did-parameters">DID Parameters</a> is OPTIONAL.

	<p>
		Implementers as well as <a>DID method</a> specification authors might use
		additional DID parameters that are not listed here. For maximum
		interoperability, it is RECOMMENDED that DID parameters use the DID
		Document Properties Extensions mechanism [[?DID-EXTENSIONS-PROPERTIES]], to avoid collision
		with other uses of the same DID parameter with different semantics.
	</p>

	<p>
		DID parameters might be used if there is a clear use case where the parameter
		needs to be part of a URL that references a <a>resource</a> with more
		precision than using the <a>DID</a> alone. It is expected that DID parameters
		are <em>not</em> used if the same functionality can be expressed by passing
		input metadata to a <a>DID resolver</a>.

	<p class="note" title="DID parameters and DID resolution">
		The <a>DID resolution</a> and the <a>DID URL dereferencing</a> functions can
		be influenced by passing <a href="#did-resolution-options"></a> or

		not part of the <a>DID URL</a>. This is comparable to
		HTTP, where certain parameters could either be included in an HTTP URL, or
		alternatively passed as HTTP headers during the dereferencing process. The
		important distinction is that DID parameters that are part of the <a>DID
		URL</a> should be used to specify <em>what <a>resource</a> is being
		identified</em>, whereas input metadata that is not part of the <a>DID URL</a>

		<h3>DID Document Metadata</h3>

		<p>This is a <a href="#metadata-structure">metadata structure</a> that contains metadata about the <a>DID Resolution</a> process.</p>
		<p>This metadata typically does not change between invocations of the <a>DID Resolution</a> function unless the <a>DID document</a> changes, as it represents data about the <a>DID document</a>.</p>
		<p>The sources of this metadata are the <a>DID controller</a> and/or the <a>DID method</a>.</p>
		<p>Examples of DID document metadata include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Timestamps when the <a>DID</a> and its associated <a>DID document</a> were created or updated (e.g., `created`, `updated`, `nextUpdate`).</li>
			<li>Versioning information about the DID document (e.g., `versionId`, `nextVersionId`).</li>
			<li>Proofs added by the <a>DID controller</a> or generated by the <a>DID method's</a> <a>verifiable data registry</a>, which might be used to establish control authority or to enable <a>verifiable reads</a> (e.g., `proof`).</li>
            <li>Metadata about controllers, capabilities, delegations, etc.</li>
            <li>Method-specific metadata, such as block number, index, transaction hash, number of confirmations, etc., of a record in the blockchain or other <a>verifiable data registry</a>.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			The possible properties within this structure and their possible values SHOULD
			be registered in the DID Document Properties Extensions [[?DID-EXTENSIONS-PROPERTIES]].
			This specification defines the following common metadata properties.
		</p>

		<dl>
			<dt><dfn class="lint-ignore">created</dfn></dt>
			<dd>
				<a>DID document</a> metadata SHOULD include a <code>created</code> property to
				indicate the timestamp of the <a data-cite="did-core#method-operations">Create operation</a>.
				The value of the property MUST be a <a data-cite="INFRA#string">string</a>
				formatted as an <a data-cite="XMLSCHEMA11-2#dateTime">XML Datetime</a>
				normalized to UTC 00:00:00 and without sub-second decimal precision. For

			</dd>

			<dt><dfn class="lint-ignore">updated</dfn></dt>
			<dd>
				<a>DID document</a> metadata SHOULD include an <code>updated</code> property to
				indicate the timestamp of the last <a data-cite="did-core#method-operations">Update
				operation</a> for the document version which was resolved. The value of the
				property MUST follow the same formatting rules as the <code>created</code>
				property. The <code>updated</code> property is omitted if an Update operation
				has never been performed on the <a>DID document</a>. If an <code>updated</code>
				property exists, it can be the same value as the <code>created</code> property
				when the difference between the two timestamps is less than one second.
			</dd>

			<dt><dfn class="lint-ignore">deactivated</dfn></dt>
			<dd>
				If a DID has been <a data-cite="did-core#method-operations">deactivated</a>,
				<a>DID document</a> metadata MUST include this property with the boolean value
				<code>true</code>. If a DID has not been deactivated, this property is OPTIONAL,
				but if included, MUST have the boolean value <code>false</code>.
			</dd>

			<dt><dfn class="lint-ignore">nextUpdate</dfn></dt>
			<dd>
				<a>DID document</a> metadata MAY include a <code>nextUpdate</code> property if
				the resolved document version is not the latest version of the document. It
				indicates the timestamp of the next <a data-cite="did-core#method-operations">Update
				operation</a>. The value of the property MUST follow the same formatting rules
				as the <code>created</code> property.
			</dd>

			<dt><dfn class="lint-ignore">versionId</dfn></dt>
			<dd>
				<a>DID document</a> metadata SHOULD include a <code>versionId</code> property to
				indicate the version of the last <a data-cite="did-core#method-operations">Update
				operation</a> for the document version which was resolved. The value of the
				property MUST be an <a data-lt="ascii string">ASCII string</a>.
			</dd>

			<dt><dfn class="lint-ignore">nextVersionId</dfn></dt>
			<dd>
				<a>DID document</a> metadata MAY include a <code>nextVersionId</code> property
				if the resolved document version is not the latest version of the document. It
				indicates the version of the next <a data-cite="did-core#method-operations">Update
				operation</a>. The value of the property MUST be an <a data-lt="ascii
string">ASCII string</a>.
			</dd>

			<dt><dfn>equivalentId</dfn></dt>
			<dd>
				<p>
					A <a>DID method</a> can define different forms of a <a>DID</a> that are
					logically equivalent. An example is when a <a>DID</a> takes one form prior to
					registration in a <a>verifiable data registry</a> and another form after such
					registration. In this case, the <a>DID method</a> specification might need to
					express one or more <a>DIDs</a> that are logically equivalent to the resolved
					<a>DID</a> as a property of the <a>DID document</a>. This is the purpose of the
					<code><a>equivalentId</a></code> property.
				</p>
				<p>
					<a>DID document</a> metadata MAY include an <code>equivalentId</code> property.
					If present, the value MUST be a <a
						data-cite="INFRA#sets">set</a> where each item is a
					<a data-cite="INFRA#string">string</a> that conforms to the rules in Section <a
						data-cite="did-core#did-syntax"></a>. The relationship is a statement that each
					<code><a>equivalentId</a></code> value is logically equivalent to the
					<code>id</code> property value and thus refers to the same <a>DID subject</a>.
					Each <code><a>equivalentId</a></code> DID value MUST be produced by, and a form
					of, the same <a>DID method</a> as the <code>id</code> property value. (e.g.,
					<code>did:example:abc</code> == <code>did:example:ABC</code>)
				</p>
				<p>
					A conforming <a>DID method</a> specification MUST guarantee that each
					<code><a>equivalentId</a></code> value is logically equivalent to the
					<code>id</code> property value.
				</p>
				<p>
					A requesting party is expected to retain the values from the <code>id</code> and
					<code><a>equivalentId</a></code> properties to ensure any subsequent
					interactions with any of the values they contain are correctly handled as
					logically equivalent (e.g., retain all variants in a database so an interaction
					with any one maps to the same underlying account).
				</p>
				<p class="note" title="Stronger equivalence">
					<code><a>equivalentId</a></code> is a much stronger form of equivalence than
					<code><a data-cite="did-core#also-known-as">alsoKnownAs</a></code> because the equivalence MUST be guaranteed by
					the governing <a>DID method</a>. The use of <code><a>equivalentId</a></code>
					means that the same <a>DID document</a> describes both the
					<code><a>equivalentId</a></code> <a>DID</a> and the <code>id</code> property
					<a>DID</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					If a requesting party does not retain the values from the <code>id</code> and
					<code><a>equivalentId</a></code> properties and ensure any subsequent
					interactions with any of the values they contain are correctly handled as
					logically equivalent, there might be negative or unexpected issues that
					arise. Implementers are strongly advised to observe the
					directives related to this metadata property.
				</p>
			</dd>

			<dt><dfn>canonicalId</dfn></dt>
			<dd>
				<p>
					The <code><a>canonicalId</a></code> property is identical to the
					<code><a>equivalentId</a></code> property except: a) it is associated with a
					single value rather than a set, and b) the <a>DID</a> is defined to be
					the canonical ID for the <a>DID subject</a> within the scope of the containing
					<a>DID document</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					<a>DID document</a> metadata MAY include a <code>canonicalId</code> property.
					If present, the value MUST be a <a
						data-cite="INFRA#string">string</a> that conforms to the rules in Section <a
						data-cite="did-core#did-syntax"></a>. The relationship is a statement that the
					<code><a>canonicalId</a></code> value is logically equivalent to the
					<code>id</code> property value and that the <code><a>canonicalId</a></code>
					value is defined by the <a>DID method</a> to be the canonical ID for the <a>DID
					subject</a> in the scope of the containing <a>DID document</a>. A
					<code><a>canonicalId</a></code> value MUST be produced by, and a form of, the
					same <a>DID method</a> as the <code>id</code> property value. (e.g.,
					<code>did:example:abc</code> == <code>did:example:ABC</code>).
				</p>
				<p>
					A conforming <a>DID method</a> specification MUST guarantee that the
					<code><a>canonicalId</a></code> value is logically equivalent to the
					<code>id</code> property value.
				</p>
				<p>
					A requesting party is expected to use the <code><a>canonicalId</a></code> value
					as its primary ID value for the <a>DID subject</a> and treat all other
					equivalent values as secondary aliases (e.g., update corresponding primary
					references in their systems to reflect the new canonical ID directive).
				</p>
				<p class="note" title="Canonical equivalence">
					<code><a>canonicalId</a></code> is the same statement of equivalence as
					<code><a>equivalentId</a></code> except it is constrained to a single value that
					is defined to be canonical for the <a>DID subject</a> in the scope of the <a>DID
					document</a>. Like <code><a>equivalentId</a></code>, the use of
					<code><a>canonicalId</a></code> means that the same
					<a>DID document</a> describes both the <code><a>canonicalId</a></code> DID and
					the <code>id</code> property <a>DID</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					If a resolving party does not use the <code><a>canonicalId</a></code> value as
					its primary ID value for the DID subject and treat all other equivalent values
					as secondary aliases, there might be negative or unexpected issues that arise
					related to user experience. Implementers are strongly advised to observe the
					directives related to this metadata property.

		The <a>DID URL dereferencing</a> function dereferences a <a>DID URL</a> into a
		<a>resource</a> with contents depending on the <a>DID URL</a>'s components,
		including the <a>DID method</a>, method-specific identifier, path, query, and
		fragment. This process depends on <a>DID resolution</a> of the <a>DID</a>
		contained in the <a>DID URL</a>. <a>DID URL dereferencing</a> might involve
		multiple steps (e.g., when the DID URL being dereferenced includes a fragment),
		and the function is defined to return the final resource after all steps are
		completed. The following figure depicts the relationship described

	<h2>Metadata Structure</h2>

	<p>
		Input and output metadata is often involved during the <a>DID Resolution</a>,
		<a>DID URL dereferencing</a>, and other DID-related processes. The structure
		used to communicate this metadata MUST be a <a data-cite="INFRA#maps">map</a>
		of properties. Each property name MUST be a <a
			data-cite="INFRA#string">string</a>. Each property value MUST be a <a
			data-cite="INFRA#string">string</a>, <a data-cite="INFRA#numbers">number</a>,
			<a data-cite="INFRA#maps">map</a>, <a data-cite="INFRA#lists">list</a>,
			<a data-cite="INFRA#sets">set</a>,
		<a data-cite="INFRA#boolean">boolean</a>, or
		<a data-cite="INFRA#nulls">null</a>. The values within any complex data
		structure such as a map or list MUST be one of these data types as well.
		All metadata property definitions registered in the DID Resolution Extensions 
		[[?DID-EXTENSIONS-RESOLUTION]] MUST define the value type, including any
		additional formats or restrictions to that value (for example, a string
		formatted as a date). It is RECOMMENDED that property
		definitions use strings for values. The entire metadata structure MUST be
		serializable according to the <a
			data-cite="INFRA#serialize-an-infra-value-to-json-bytes">JSON
		serialization rules</a> in the [[INFRA]] specification. Implementations MAY
		serialize the metadata structure to other data formats.

			(for example, IEEE-754 floating-point vs. fixed-width integers vs.
			“bigint”/bignum types). The
			<a data-cite="INFRA#numbers">Infra</a> standard does not yet provide
			comprehensive guidance for numbers. Implementers are advised to avoid
			metadata numbers that are likely to be represented differently on
			different platforms — notably the following:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>non-integer values such as floating-point numbers or fractions</li>
			<li>integers outside common fixed-width ranges, such as those larger
			than a 32-bit unsigned integer (maximum <code>2<sup>32</sup> - 1</code>
			or <code>4,294,967,295</code>)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Where such values are needed for interoperability,
			a good practice for property is definitions to use
			a canonical <strong>string</strong> serialization (for example, a
			string formatted as a floating-point number using a clearly defined
			precision and rounding strategy) and to document any expected
			range or format.
		</p>
		</aside>

	<p>
		All implementations of functions that use metadata structures as either input or
		output are able to fully represent all data types described here in a
		deterministic fashion. As inputs and outputs using metadata structures are
		defined in terms of data types and not their serialization, the method for
		<a>representation</a> is internal to the implementation of the function and is
		out of scope of this specification.

		<h2>Method Architectures</h2>
		<p>The <a>DID resolution</a> algorithm involves executing the <a data-cite="did-core#method-operations">Read</a>
		operation on a <a>DID</a> according to its <a>DID method</a> (see <a href="#resolving"></a>).</p>

		<p>Every DID method defines this method operation, i.e.,
            how a <a>DID resolver</a> can obtain a DID document from a DID. The underlying
            data formats, protocols, technical infrastructures, and processes can vary considerably among
		    <a>DID methods</a>.</p>

        <p>Examples of DID method considerations include the following:</p>
		<ul>
          <li>A DID method might use an immutable blockchain, distributed ledger, distributed file system,
            peer-to-peer network, or other decentralized infrastructure as (part of) its
            <a>verifiable data registry</a>.
          </li>
          <li>A DID method might use DNS, HTTP, or web servers as (part of) its <a>verifiable data registry</a>.
          </li>
          <li>A DID method might use any combination of the above technical infrastructures.
          </li>
          <li>A DID method might store an actual <a>DID document</a> in plain-text form in a
            <a>verifiable data registry</a> and might simply retrieve that document during the "Read" operation.
          </li>
          <li>A DID method might define its "Read" operation in a more complex way that could involve
            intermediate, partial, or temporary <a>DID documents</a>, and use multi-step processes
            that construct the <a>DID document</a> "on-the-fly".
          </li>
          <li>A DID method might require interaction with remote servers or networks during execution
            of the "Read" operation.
          </li>
          <li>A DID method might execute the "Read" operation in an entirely local way that does not require any
            interaction with remote servers or networks. For example, in the [[DID-KEY]] method,
            the DID itself wraps a public key, and the "Read" operation is simply a trivial, local transformation
            process.
          </li>
		</ul>
		</p>

		<p>Based on the above considerations combined with the nature of a <a>DID method's</a> "Read" operation, the interaction between a
		<a>DID resolver</a> and the <a>verifiable data registry</a> could be considered either a <a>verifiable read</a>
		or an <a>unverifiable read</a>:</p>

		<figure id="figure-architecture-method-verifiable">
			<img style="margin: auto; display: block; width: 100%; margin-bottom: 20px;" src="diagrams/section-7/architecture-method-verifiable.svg"

			<figcaption style="text-align: center;">
				A <a>verifiable read</a> implementation of a <a>DID method</a>.

		<figure id="figure-architecture-method-unverifiable">

			<figcaption style="text-align: center;">
				An <a>unverifiable read</a> implementation of a <a>DID method</a>.
			</figcaption>
		</figure>

		<p>
			A <a>verifiable read</a> maximizes confidence in the integrity and correctness of the result of the "Read" operation, to the extent
			possible under the applicable <a>DID method</a>. This can be accomplished in a number of ways, such as the following:
		</p>

		<ul>
		<li>A <a>verifiable read</a> can be accomplished if access to the <a>verifiable data registry</a> is
			possible in a local, trusted network environment.
            <ul>
                <li>For example, in blockchain-based <a>DID methods</a>, a
                <a>verifiable read</a> might be accomplished if a blockchain full node is deployed on a local server.</li>
            </ul></li>
        <li>If access to the <a>verifiable data registry</a> happens via a remote server, a <a>verifiable read</a> might
            still be accomplished if the remote server is trusted, and if it can be accessed via
            a secure channel.</li>
        <li>If access to the <a>verifiable data registry</a> happens via a remote server, a <a>verifiable read</a> might
            be accomplished if the <a>DID resolver</a> has some way of verifying the <a>DID document</a> and
            <a href="#did-document-metadata">DID document metadata</a> returned by the DID method.
            <ul>
            <li>For example, in blockchain-based <a>DID methods</a>, even if direct access to a blockchain
                full node is not available, a <a>verifiable read</a> may still be possible by using a light client that
                processes metadata to verify the data.</li>
            </ul></li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			An <a>unverifiable read</a> does not have such guarantees and is therefore less desirable, for example:
		</p>

		<ul>
        <li>An <a>unverifiable read</a> takes place if access to the <a>verifiable data registry</a> happens
			via a remote, untrusted intermediary.
            <ul>
            <li>For example, in the case of blockchain-based <a>DID methods</a>, a remote blockchain explorer API
			    operated by an third party may be used to look up data from the blockchain.</li>
            </ul></li>
		</ul>

		<p class="note" title="Implementation Details">
			Whether or not a <a>verifiable read</a> is possible depends not only on a <a>DID method</a> itself, but also on the way
			a <a>DID resolver</a> implements that <a>DID method</a>. <a>DID methods</a> MAY allow multiple ways of implementing their "Read"
			operation, and SHOULD offer guidance regarding at least one way to implement a <a>verifiable read</a>.
		</p>

		<p class="note" title="Limitations of Verifiable Data Registries">
			The guarantees associated with a <a>verifiable read</a> are always limited by the architecture(s), protocol(s), cryptographic element(s),
            and other aspects of the <a>DID method's</a> underlying <a>verifiable data registry</a>. The forms of <a>verifiable read</a> implementation
            that are considered strongest are those that require no interaction with any remote network (for example, see
            [[DID-KEY]]), and those that minimize dependencies on specific network infrastructure, reducing the "root of trust"
            to proven entropy and cryptography (for example, see [[KERI]]).
		</p>

        <p>
            To enable <a>verifiable reads</a>, many DID methods use digital signatures, state proofs, proofs of
            inclusion in Merkle trees, cryptographic event logs, or other types of proofs. If a <a>DID method</a>
            uses such proofs, it MUST specify in its DID method specification how they are used for
            verification of the correctness of the result of a "Read" operation.
        </p>

        <p>
            A <a>DID method</a> MAY also include such proofs in the <a>DID document</a> itself, or
            in a <code>proof</code> property of the
            <a href="#did-document-metadata">DID document metadata</a>.
            This can potentially enable a <a>client</a> to independently verify the results of a
            <a>DID Resolution</a> process, even if it does not trust the <a>DID resolver</a>.
		</p>

		<p class="advisement">
			Note that proofs originating from the <a>DID method</a> are <a>DID method</a>-specific
			and must be understood within the technology of the applicable <a>DID method</a>.
			A simple signature on a
            <a>DID document</a> or <a href="#did-document-metadata">DID document metadata</a> does not
            necessarily prove control of a DID, nor guarantee that the <a>DID document</a> is the correct
            one for the <a>DID</a>.
			These proofs help to verify the integrity and authenticity of the results of a
			<a>DID Resolution</a> process as far as the <a>DID method</a> itself is concerned.
			However, they do not guarantee that the <a>binding</a> between a <a>client</a> and the
			<a>DID resolver</a> is secure. See also <a href="#resolver-architectures"></a>.

		<h2>Resolver Architectures</h2>
		<p>The algorithms for <a>DID resolution</a> and <a>DID URL dereferencing</a> are defined as abstract functions
		(see <a href="#resolving"></a> and <a href="#dereferencing"></a>).</p>

        <p>
            Those algorithms are implemented by <a>DID resolvers</a> and <a>DID URL dereferencers</a>,
            which are invoked by a <a>client</a> via a <a>binding</a>. Bindings define how the abstract functions are
            accessed using concrete programming or communication interfaces.
        </p>

        <p>Examples of bindings include the following:
        <ul>
            <li>A <a>DID resolver</a> might be invoked within an application by calling a software library or SDK.</li>
            <li>A <a>DID resolver</a> might be invoked as a command line tool.</li>
            <li>A <a>DID resolver</a> might be invoked over an HTTP(S) API or other network protocol, e.g., see <a href="#bindings-https"></a>.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p>Based on the above considerations combined with the nature of the binding, the interaction between a
            <a>client</a> and the <a>DID resolver</a> or <a>DID URL dereferencer</a> could be considered either a <a>local binding</a>
            or a <a>remote binding</a>:</p>

		<figure id="figure-architecture-binding-local">

			<figcaption style="text-align: center;">
				A <a>remote binding</a> for a <a>DID resolver</a>.
			</figcaption>
		</figure>

        <p>
            Whenever possible, <a>local bindings</a> are preferred, as they minimize dependencies on third parties
            and intermediaries, reduce security risks, and maximize confidence in the integrity and correctness of the
            results of the <a>DID resolution</a> and <a>DID URL dereferencing</a> functions.
        </p>

        <p>
            In some cases, it might not be possible to use a <a>local binding</a>; for example, in constrained IoT (Internet of Things)
            environments, or when a <a>DID method</a> requires complex infrastructure, or when many different <a>DID
            methods</a> should be supported.
        </p>

        <p>
            If a <a>client</a> uses a <a>remote binding</a>, the following considerations apply:
            <ul>
                <li>The <a>remote binding</a> SHOULD use a trusted instance of a <a>DID resolver</a>, ideally
                    under the control of the <a>client</a> itself (e.g., self-hosted).</li>
                <li>The <a>remote binding</a> SHOULD use a secure channel such as VPN and/or TLS with mutual authentication.</li>
                <li>The <a>client</a> could query multiple <a>DID resolvers</a> over a <a>remote binding</a> and compare results.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            A <a>DID resolver</a> MAY also include proofs
            in a <code>proof</code> property of the
            <a href="#did-resolution-metadata">DID resolution metadata</a>.
            This inclusion can potentially enable a <a>client</a> to independently verify the results of a
            <a>DID Resolution</a> process, as long as it trusts the <a>DID resolver</a>.
        </p>

        <p class="advisement">
            Note that proofs originating from a <a>DID resolver</a> are
            <a>DID method</a>-independent and can be universally applied by a <a>DID resolver</a>,
            across all DID methods. These proofs help to
            verify the integrity and authenticity of the results of a <a>DID Resolution</a> process
            as far as the <a>DID resolver</a> itself is concerned. However, they do not guarantee that the result
            from the "Read" operation of the applicable <a>DID method</a> is itself correct.

			<h2>Multiple Methods</h2>

			<p>A <a>DID resolver</a> MUST support the <a>DID resolution</a> algorithm for at least one <a>DID method</a> and

		<h2>Proxied Resolution</h2>

		<p>A <a>DID resolver</a> MAY invoke another <a>DID resolver</a>, which serves as a proxy that executes
		the <a>DID resolution</a> algorithm as defined in <a href="#resolving"></a>.</p>

		<p>The first <a>DID resolver</a> then acts
		as a <a>client</a> and chooses a suitable <a>binding</a> for invoking the second <a>DID resolver</a>. For example, a <a>DID resolver</a> may be
		invoked via a <a>local binding</a> (such as a command line tool), which in turn invokes another <a>DID resolver</a>
		via a <a>remote binding</a> (such as the <a href="#bindings-https">HTTP(S) binding</a>).</p>

        <p>When using proxied resolution, a "downstream" resolver SHOULD preserve all
          <a href="#did-resolution-metadata">DID resolution metadata</a> and
          <a href="#did-document-metadata">DID document metadata</a> from an
          "upstream" resolver in a transparent manner, including any proofs that may be

          any metadata about the proxied resolution process itself.</p>

<section id="errors">
	<h1>Errors</h1>
	<p>
		The algorithms described in this specification throw specific types of errors.
		Implementers might find it useful to convey these errors to other libraries or
		software systems. This section provides specific URLs and descriptions for the errors,
		such that an ecosystem implementing technologies described
		by this specification might interoperate more effectively when errors occur. Additionally,
		this specification uses some errors defined in <a data-cite="CID#processing-errors">Section
		3.5 Processing Errors</a> of the [[CID]] specification.
	</p>

	<p>
		Implementers SHOULD use
		[[RFC9457]] to encode the error data structure. If [[RFC9457]] is used:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
The `type` value of the error object MUST be a URL. Where the values listed
in the section below do not define a URL, the values MUST be prepended with the
URL `https://www.w3.org/ns/did#`.
		</li>
		<li>
The `title` value SHOULD provide a short but specific human-readable string for
the error.
		</li>
		<li>
The `detail` value SHOULD provide a longer human-readable string for the error.

	<h1>Bindings</h1>
	<p>This section defines bindings for the abstract algorithms in sections <a href="#resolving"></a> and
	<a href="#dereferencing"></a>.</p>

	<section id="bindings-https">
		<h2>HTTP(S) Binding</h2>
		<p>This section defines a <a>DID resolver</a> <a>binding</a> which exposes the
			<a>DID resolution</a> and/or <a>DID URL dereferencing</a> functions (including all
			resolution/dereferencing options and metadata) via an HTTP(S) endpoint. See <a href="#resolver-architectures"></a>.</p>

		<p>The HTTP(S) binding requires a known HTTP(S) URL where a <a>DID resolver</a> can be invoked. This URL is called the
			<var><a>DID resolver</a> HTTP(S) endpoint</var>.</p>

		<p>This binding is generally considered a <a>remote binding</a>, but could
			also be a <a>local binding</a> if the HTTP(S) endpoint is run in a local environment, such as on <code>localhost</code>.</p>

		<p>Using this binding, the <a>DID resolution</a> function (see
			<a href="#resolving"></a>) and/or <a>DID URL dereferencing</a> function (see <a href="#dereferencing"></a>)
			can be executed as follows:</p>

	<section id="authentication">
		<h2>Authentication/Authorization</h2>
		<p><a>DID resolution</a> and <a>DID URL dereferencing</a> do not involve any authentication or authorization
		functionality. Similar to DNS resolution, anybody can perform the process, without requiring any credentials
		or non-public knowledge.</p>

		<p class="issue" data-number="38"></p>

		<div class="issue">
		<p>Explain that DIDs are not necessarily <em>globally</em> resolvable, such as pairwise or N-wise
		"peer" DIDs.</p>
		<p>See [[RFC3339]]:
		<em> URIs have a global scope and are interpreted consistently regardless of context, though the
		result of that interpretation may be in relation to the end-user's context.</em>
		</p>
		<p>An advanced idea is that the result of DID resolution could be contextual or depend on policies,
		see <a href="https://github.com/w3c/did-resolution/issues/28#issuecomment-510592199">this comment</a>.</p>
		</div>

		<p class="issue">A related topic is whether (parts of) DID document could be encrypted, e.g.,
		<a href="https://github.com/w3c/did-core/issues/25">w3c/did-core/issues/25</a>. Also see the use
		of the fragment in the <a href="https://did-ipid.github.io/ipid-did-method/">IPID</a> DID method.</p>

	<section id="caching">
		<h2>Caching</h2>
		<p>A <a>DID resolver</a> may maintain a generic cache of <a>DID documents</a>. It may also
			maintain caches specific to certain <a>DID methods</a>.</p>
		<p>The <code>noCache</code> resolution option can be used to
			request a certain kind of caching behavior.</p>
			<p>This <var>resolution option</var> is OPTIONAL.</p>
			<p>Possible values of this property are:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>`"false"` (default value): Caching of <a>DID documents</a> is allowed.</li>
			<li>`"true"`: Request that caching is disabled and a fresh <a>DID document</a> is retrieved from
			the <a>verifiable data registry</a>.</li>
			</ul>
		<p>Caching behavior can be controlled by configuration of the <a>DID resolver</a>,
			by the <code>noCache</code> resolution option, or by contents of the DID document
			(e.g., a `cacheMaxTtl` field), or by a combination of these properties.</p>

		<p>Resolvers that implement noCache might be more vulnerable to denial of service attacks,
			as malicious clients can bypass caching to force expensive network requests and resource consumption.
			Clients requesting resolution with <code>noCache</code> expect that some resolvers will reject resolution requests that bypass caching.
			Resolvers that deny resolution without caching MUST respond with a <a href="#FEATURE_NOT_SUPPORTED">FEATURE_NOT_SUPPORTED</a> error that makes it clear that bypassing the cache was not permitted
			so the client can attempt to resolve without using <code>noCache</code>.</p>

	<section id="json-ld-integrity">
		<h2>JSON-LD Context Integrity</h2>
			<p>If <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11/#the-context">JSON-LD Context</a> files are fetched from a remote location, an attacker could alter the context file (for example, by compromising the server or intercepting the request via a man-in-the-middle attack).
			</p>
			<p>Therefore, any <a>DID resolver</a> which performs remote retrieval of JSON-LD Context URLs is strongly advised to use a registry of context files and corresponding hashes (or a functionally equivalent mechanism) to help ensure end-to-end security. Implementations are expected to throw errors if the cryptographic hash value for a resource does not match the expected hash value.</p>
	</section>

	<section id="versioning">
		<h2>Versioning</h2>
		<p>If a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#did-parameters"><code>versionId</code></a> or
			<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#did-parameters"><code>versionTime</code></a> DID parameter
			is provided, the <a>DID resolution</a>
			algorithm returns a specific version of the <a>DID document</a>.</p>
		<p>The DID parameters <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#did-parameters"><code>versionId</code></a>
			and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#did-parameters"><code>versionTime</code></a>
			are mutually exclusive.</p>
		<p>The use of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#did-parameters"><code>versionId</code></a> DID parameter is specific to the <a>DID method</a>.
			Its possible values may include sequential numbers, random UUIDs, content hashes, etc..</p>
		<p>DID document metadata MAY contain a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#did-parameters"><code>versionId</code></a>
			property that changes with each  <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#method-operations">Update</a> operation that is performed
			on a DID document.</p>
		<p class="note">While most <a>DID methods</a> support the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#method-operations">Update</a>
			operation, there is no requirement for <a>DID methods</a> to keep all previous <a>DID document</a> versions, therefore
			not all <a>DID methods</a> support versioning.</p>

	<section id="vdr-forks">
		<h2>VDR Network Forks</h2>
		<p><a>DID methods</a> that use a distributed system (such as a distributed ledger) as a
			VDR (<a>verifiable data registry</a>) need to manage the potential that network forks may occur. Therefore,
			the specification of a <a>DID method</a> that uses a distributed system as a VDR SHOULD specify a means by which
			the VDR they are using can be disambiguated from such forks.</p>
	</section>

	<section id="security-cycles-resolution">
		<h2>Resolution Cycles</h2>

		<p>When a <a>DID resolver</a> client dereferences identifiers and linked resources in a <a>DID document</a> —
			especially fields like <code>verificationMethod</code>, <code>controller</code>,
			or <code>alsoKnownAs</code> — it might encounter a <a>resolution cycle</a>.
			These can occur when a <a>DID document</a> references another DID (or URL) that eventually leads
			back to a previously dereferenced identifier, forming a loop. A <a>DID resolver</a> can
			also encounter such a situation when dereferencing a <a>DID URL</a> that references
			a <a>service endpoint</a>.</p>

		<div class="example" title="Cycle Through Controllers">
			<pre><code>did:example:alice
	└── verificationMethod.controller → did:example:bob
		└── verificationMethod.controller → did:example:alice</code></pre>
		</div>

		<p><strong><a>DID resolvers</a> and their clients that perform recursive dereferencing
			are expected to expect, detect, and handle such cycles</strong>.</p>

		<p><strong>Security and performance risks:</strong> If cycles are not detected and mitigated,
			recursive dereferencing could lead to:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Infinite loops</strong> or <strong>stack overflows</strong> in software.</li>
			<li><strong>Resource exhaustion</strong> (e.g., memory, network, or CPU).</li>
			<li><strong>Denial-of-service (DoS)</strong> vulnerabilities in clients or intermediaries.</li>
		</ul>

		<p><strong>Mitigation guidance:</strong> Components that recursively
			follow external <a>DID document</a> references are encouraged to
			track identifiers that have already been dereferenced and to detect when a cycle has
			occurred and take appropriate action. In addition, developers might wish to limit
			recursion depth or breadth to reduce the potential attack surface.</p>

		<h2>Profiling of DID Resolution and Dereferencing Requesters</h2>
		<p><a>DID resolvers</a> and <a>DID URL dereferencers</a> will be able to log requests

			and profile the clients making requests for these services. To mitigate this privacy risk,
			clients should make such requests to services they trust, for example,
			because of an existing business relationship or because the service is running on

<section class="appendix">
	<h1>Relationship to Other Technologies</h1>

	<p>
One of the most common mechanisms used to resolve an identifier to an address on
the Internet is the global Domain Name System (DNS) described in [[?RFC1034]].
The DNS and the processes and systems used to map a Domain Name to an Internet
Protocol address is a common requirement for hosting a website.
	</p>
	<p>
The [[[DID]]] specification introduced a new type of identifier that lacks
any dependency on the global Domain Name System and introduced the concept of
an identifier resolution process that does not require the centralization of
any part of the architecture. This new architecture allows the decentralized
creation and management of globally-resolvable identifiers that combat
identifier rent-seeking and censorship. It enables individuals to fully
own and control their identifiers instead of renting the identifiers from a
third party.
	</p>
	<p>
Individuals that acquire [=DID URLs=] use them in their software much like
they continue to use DNS-based URLs. The software uses a [=DID resolver=]
interface (defined in this specification) to determine the location of the
resources to be retrieved. The process of [=DID resolution=], much like the
process of DNS resolution, is opaque to the individual and happens within
the software without needing any direct involvement of the individual.
	</p>
	<p>
The research related to DNS centralization and the corresponding invention of
[=DIDs=] and [=DID resolution=] is documented by the [[[?DID]]] specification in
the section related to the
<a data-cite="DID#acknowledgements">history of DIDs</a>.
